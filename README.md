### About

With the increasing acceptance of web3 and the emergence of so many unique and innovative blockchain networks and dapps, getting the right data becomes extremely difficult. Getting on-chain data comes with challenges regardless of how big or small the dapp is or how densely populated their data is.

Existing platforms are either centralized (gitcoin) or don't directly focus on much smaller data requirements. The platforms are neither transparent nor permissionless and it is just a task to...put up a task.

Another issue the platforms usually encounter is that of the Dapp/Data requestor not being able to communicate with the data-finding community enough for them to understand what the requirements are for providing feedback on a one-on-one basis

What if there was a dapp that could help them connect with professionals/people who could

answer their questions, support a decentralized chat platform for dapps/data requestors to communicate with the data finders, and get their requirements met?

### Documentation
_Introducing..._ 
**DataQuest**

Web3’s first truly decentralized platform connects people with data requirements to folks who can bring them the data they need.

**Some of our features are:**

- Permissionless Platform
- Transparent
- Supports All Token

**How to use our platform?**

- Go to [questnow.live](http://questnow.live/)
- Click on Launch App.
- If you’re a data requestor, Click on Create Question.
- Fill in the required information and click on Submit.
- This will create the question, which will be available on the discover page. It will be displayed with the time duration, description, and amount mentioned in the form.
- Once this is live, the answerer can see the live questions and start working on them. Once he finds the relevant answers, he can click on submit.
- Upon clicking submit, a box opens up showing 3 columns where the answerer can add further details about their submission
- The answerers also get a Talk to Dapp option where the answerer can talk to the Dapp in order to ask further questions/receive feedback upon submission.
- All the submissions are public and can be seen under the submissions tab.
- Once the time period for the question raised/asked is over, the data requestor can select the winner out of the submissions based on the division they have given in the beginning while filing the form
- Once the winners are selected, the winner's wallet will be notified via the Push notification feature about their victory.
